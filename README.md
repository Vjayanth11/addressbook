ðŸ“’ Address Book System

This project is a Java-based Address Book System that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, console input handling, and collection framework usage. Each use case (UC) is developed on a separate Git branch and then merged into the main branch.

ðŸ“Œ What I Learnt
ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts

Writing modular Java code with naming conventions and indentation.

Managing version control using Git branching, merging, and commit history.

Importance of code hygiene for project reviews.

ðŸ”¹ Address Book Features

UC 1: Add a new contact (first name, last name, address, city, state, zip, phone, email).

UC 2: Edit existing contact details using their name.

UC 3: Delete a contact by name.

UC 4: Add multiple contacts into the Address Book using Collections.

UC 5: Refactor to support multiple Address Books, each with a unique name.

UC 6: Display exit/thank-you message.

ðŸ”¹ Collections Usage

Used ArrayList to store multiple contacts.

Used HashMap (Dictionary) to manage multiple Address Books with unique names.

Practiced CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with collections.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Compile the program:

javac AddressBookMain.java


Run the program:

java AddressBookMain

ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes

Gained hands-on practice with Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

Learnt to manage data using Collections Framework.

Applied real-world features like managing multiple address books.

Improved skills in Git branching and collaboration workflow.
